    o    varimp can now partially deal with missing values

    o    Kaplan-Meier curves are now computed _after_ removing

    o    observations with missing values in newdata might not have gone 
         with the majority in predict(<ctree>, newdata) when no surrogate 
         split was applicable. Spotted and fixed by 
         Vik <viknesh@stat.ufl.edu>.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-99994 (2011-08-22)

         in cforest_control())


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-9995 (2010-05-19)

    o    assignment of observations based on surrogate splits
         during fitting might have failed; observations went
         with majority (in a sub-optimal way)


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-9994 (2010-04-14)

    o    varimp() gives warning for non-unity weights

    o    p-values for teststat = "max" were wrong
         in the uncommon case of zero variances


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-998 (2009-06-17)

    o    mtry may vary with tree depth

                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-99 (2008-10-28)

    o   a suboptimal split was implemented when the best
        split corresponded to the last row of <data> due to
        a coding error. This should have happend only very
        rarely, however, the glaucoma example is affected.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-98 (2008-10-15)

    o   don't compute ordering of censored variables (thanks to
        Brian D. Ripley for the report)

    o   experimental version of partialPlot for cforests

    o   teststat = "quad" and testtype = "Univariate" produced
        wrong criteria in the presence of constant exploratory variables.
        Spotted by Sebastian Wietzke <Sebastian.Wietzke@axa.de>


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-97 (2008-06-26)

        wrong. Bug spotted by Wei-Yin Loh <loh@stat.wisc.edu>

    o   vignette updates


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-96 (2008-06-06)

    o   make searching for surrogate splits a little more stable


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-95 (2008-02-27)

    o   proximity() now gives _relative_ numbers 
        (similar to `randomForest'), not absolute numbers
        long-standing feature request by Henric Nilsson


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-94 (2008-01-30)

    o   documentation updates


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-93 (2007-11-30)

    o   It is now an error to ask for more surrogate variables
        than actually available. Thanks to Henric Nilsson.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-92 (2007-11-22)

    o   predict(<ctree-object>) computed predictions
        for observations with zero weights (by passing them down the tree).
        This was already done this way by predict(<cforest-object>) but resulted
        in an error for ctree()s.

    o   minbucket added to ctree_control()


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-91 (2007-09-26)

    o   bugfix: NAs in factors lead to segfaults on 64bit machines
        as reported by Carolin Strobl <carolin.strobl@lmu.de>

    o   related to this: be more careful when splitting in
        variables containing missing values, especially factors.

    o   add examples to regression tests

    o   new function `proximity' (feature request by Henric Nilsson)


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-90 (2007-09-24)

    o   new defaults for `control' argument of `cforest': unbiased
        forests are now grown by default

    o   new defaults for binary classification tree visualization:
        stacked bar charts are used by default.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-14 (2007-07-23)

    o   fix problem in `varimp' introduced by new weights handling


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-13 (2007-07-23)

    o   update `mvt.f'

    o   improve the memory footprint of RandomForest objects
        substancially (by removing the weights slots from each node).
        
        More careful revision of the predict and fitting code is needed.

    o   predictions for cforest with multivariate response are
        now returned in a matrix (should be a data.frame)

    o   remove confusing `no admissible split found' warning 
        (which simply meant that the `minsplit' wasn't met).


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-12 (2007-06-28)

    o   adjust to coin 0.6-4


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-11 (2007-06-11)

    o   populate `where' slot in `mob' objects.

    o   `mob_control' now has an `na.action' argument

    o   cforest with replace = FALSE, fraction = ...
        can now deal with weights (spotted by Carolin Strobl
        <carolin.strobl@stat.uni-muenchen.de>)

    o   interface to LAPACK (`dgesdd' for computing a SVD)
        directly. As a side-effect, the svdmem class can be 
        simplified and no memory allocation during 
        tree growing is necessary (which results in a measureable
        performance gain)


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-10 (2007-02-28)

    o   internal infrastructure for fit(x, y) interfaces,
        including a VariableFrame method for matrices.

    o   deal with factors with only one level and variables where
        all observations are NA

    o   don't compute design matrices in `ModelEnvFormula'


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-9 (2007-02-02)

    o   internal changes to data objects: joint transformations
        only necessary for response variables (new class `ResponseFrame')
        but we need to distinguish between testing (using ranks, for
        example) and prediction (means of raw data!).

        Problem spotted by Henric Nilsson <nilsson.henric@gmail.com>.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-8 (2007-01-15)

    o   thicker median lines in boxplots


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-7 (2007-01-15)

    o   fix problems with multivariate response variables
        (spotted by Henric Nilsson <henric.nilsson@sorch.se>)


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-6 (2006-11-28)

    o   R-2.5.0 does not allow to change the storage.mode of factors


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-5 (2006-10-27)

    o   adjusted p values computed with testtype = "MonteCarlo"
        did not take dimensionality of the underlying linear statistics
        into account. It is now ensured that _p values_ are resampled,
        not test statistics.

    o   fix escape problems


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-4 (2006-09-15)

    o   make sure `maxsurrogates' exceeds number of input variables

    o   fix problems reported by valgrind


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-3 (2006-09-08)

    o    don't call RNG functions in mvt (this is done in C code, once)


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-2 (2006-09-07)

    o    mob() can't currently handle missing values,
         they are removed and a warning is given.

    o    add `methods' and `vcd' to Depends:


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.9-0 (2006-08-31)

    o    node_barplot() can now also draw stacked barplots.

    o    simplify handling of ordinal variables. It is now possible
         to have multiple (ordinal) response variables.

    o    some documentation updates

    o    fix problems with NA handling for factors

    o    make sure minsplit criterion applies in the presence of missing
         values. Bug spotted by Han Lee <Han.Lee@geodecapital.com>.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-8 (2006-08-23)

    o    export `varimp' (variable importance measures for cforest())

    o    documentation updates

    o    add codetools checks


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-7 (2006-07-17)

    o    REAL(NULL) now gives an error in C code and scores could be 
         potentially NULL: fixed for the time being.

    o    add `show' method for BinaryTree and RandomForest objects


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-6 (2006-05-22)

    o    add some validity checks for hyper parameters

    o    add function `varimp' for computing variable importance
         measures for some random forests (this is still experimental and
         thus not exported yet, so use `party:::varimp')


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-5 (2006-04-25)

    o    all hyper parameters to `cforest' are now controlled using
         objects of a new class `ForestControl' which can be created using
         `cforest_control()'. 

    o    sampling of a fraction of the observations without replacement
         is now available for the `cforest' implementation of random forest.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-4 (2006-04-04)

    o    renamed argument `teststattype' to `teststat' with defaults
         c("quad", "max") in order to be compatible with the `coin' package, 
         version >= 0.4-5

    o    use `1 - (1 - p)^k' instead of `p * k' for Bonferroni-adjustment.
         Node 7 for the `GlaucomaM' data is now splitted in addition (in tms).


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-3 (2006-03-20)

    o   `predict' returned nonsensical results in case a tree was 
        fitted to a multivariate response variable. Now a list with one
        element for each observation is returned.


                CHANGES IN party VERSION 0.8-2 (2006-03-01)

    o    plotting buglets fixed: improved axis in MOB plots,
         correct (transparent) background on jpeg() and png() devices.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.8-1 (2006-02-23)

    o    `testtype' can be Bonferroni, MonteCarlo, Univariate and
         Teststatistic (instead of Raw)		

    o    removed unnecessary constraint on weights in `cforest'

    o    maximize raw test statistics for random forest by default.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.8-0 (2006-02-15)		

    o    `cforest', an implementation of Breiman's random forest ensemble
         algorithm based on conditional inference trees (`ctree') has been
	 added. It is somewhat experimental and thus for advanced users only.

    o    `mob', an object-oriented implementation of a recently suggested
         algorithm for model-based recursive partitioning (Zeileis, Hothorn,
	 Hornik, 2005) has been added. It works out of the box for partitioning
	 (generalized) linear regression models, others can be easily plugged
	 in. A new vignette "MOB" describes the implementation ideas and provides
	 a few examples.

    o    new S3 generic reweight() with methods for (g)linearModel
         for re-fitting a model with different weights.

    o    new argument `maxdepth' to `ctree_control' which allows for
         growing trees of a fixed maximum depth.

    o    LazyData: yes
    

		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-6 (2006-02-06)

		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-4 (2006-01-18)

    o    documentation updates


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-3 (2006-01-18)

    o    some new convenience functions, not exported


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-2 (2006-01-12)

    o    isequal must not check equality of attributes


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-1 (2005-12-02)

    o    fix bug introduced in version 0.3-0: coin:::factor_trafo applies
         treatment contrasts in case of a binary factor but we need the full
         design matrix

    o    documentation updates


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.3-0 (2005-11-29)

    o    `ytrafo' and `xtrafo' functions make use of `coin:::trafo' now,
         i.e. the handling of influence functions and transformations
         has been unified in packages `party' and `coin'


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-10 (2005-11-08)

    o    new slot `data' in BinaryTree objects, slots inputnames and levels 
         have been removed


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-9 (2005-10-19)

    o    splits in categorical variables could have failed due 
         to weired internal checks


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-8 (2005-08-06)

    o    fix problems reported by codetools


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-7 (2005-08-31)

    o    extract inputs using menv@get("input", data = newdata) in predict


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-6 (2005-08-29)

    o   make gfortran happy


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-5 (2005-08-19)

    o    ctree() now searches the global environment for variables given
         in `formula' when the `data' argument is unspecified.


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-4 (2005-07-07)

    o    names of `criterion' element in `SplittingNode' objects were wrong

    o    categorical splits with `ctree_control(testtype = "MonteCarlo")'
         were potentially wrong


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-3 (2005-06-29)

    o   print and plot only levels which are available in a node (for nominal
        splits)


		CHANGES IN `party' VERSION 0.2-2 (2005-06-27)

    o   ./src/Makedeps will be automatically generated (on Windows)
        and must not be part of the source-package.

    o   vignette cosmetics
